# Facial Keypoints Detection 

A take on the Kaggle Facial Keypoints Recognition Challenge. A notebook containing code for accepting an image containing a face and identifying key points on the face which include, eyebrows (inner and outer side), eyes (center, inner corner and outer corner), nose tip, mouth sides, and center of top lip and bottom lip. The notebook contains filtering of the Kaggle facial dataset to only include acceptable examples, meaning all the samples in the dataset containing all keypoints. Since this reduced the dataset significantly, transformations of the images were implemented to increase the diversity of the training set. This included rotation, flipping, lighting changes, centering position of object in image, adding noise, and adding blur to eventually increase the number of examples 20 fold. Convectional Neural Networks (CNN) was trained on the dataset to identify the keypoints previously mentioned. The CNN models were built using tensorflow 3 with Keras. The simplest model included two convolutional layers with rectifide linear unit activations, maxpooling layers sandwiched in between, and a hidden layer and final output layer of 30 nodes. The complex model added more convolutional layers, totaling 4, and more hidden layers to the simpler model. Models performed decently when submitted on Kaggle, giving RMSE 5.9 for simple and RMSE 7.4 for complex.
